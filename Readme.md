# Odd's Very Special Xml Serializer

..Or OVSXmlSerializer for short.

The system functions very simply: You put an object inside and it will serialize
into a file or such in around 1-2 lines of code. Additionally, is meant to be 
worked with the `object` or more 'undefined' data that the ordinary XML serializer 
have difficulty handling, along with simulating reference types via ID.


Unlike the traditional XML Serializer, this will use the type parameters in the
class to automatically differentiate enums and arrays, which will remove the 
need to mark fields as `[XmlArray]` or `[XmlEnum]`. In place, there are custom 
serializers that you can insert in the config.

## Explicit Types

The unique function of this XML serializer over others is its *explicit type 
handling.* What this does is that it allows it to reserve its derived types when
considering base types, down to the level of `object`. This feature can be turned
on or off.

This feature is enabled by default, but modifying the serializer/config interface, 
this can be turned  off. It will also implicitly convert `System.Xml.XmlWriterSettings` 
to the config to ensure smooth transtion between systems.

There are 3 options you can enable:
1. **Always Included** - Regardless of the situation, it will write the type.
2. **Smart Types** - When defined out of the base field, it will write the type.
3. **Ignore** - It will never write the type, which may show incorrect behaviour.

## Serializing

Like the default system XML serializer, they pose the same requirements such as:
1. Requiring to have a public or private parameterless constructor.
2. Having all fields follow the same constraint as above.
3. During certain restrictions like a limited environment may cause issues; Modifying
the readonly handle option in the config seems to fix this.

There are two serializers, the generic and the non-generic. The non-generic derives
from the generic as object for simplicity, and is typically created as instances
due to configurations. Though, there is a shared static parameter for both generic
and non-generic serializers.

When done serializing as an XML, it typically returns a stream, or applies to a
new or existing file or stream.

Note that it does removes the initial xml version and encoding at the top, as it
always to be assumed UTF-8 and on version 1.0. This can be changed in the config
of course.

## Deserializing

Requires the stream or XML file to retrieve the object mentioned by the XML.
It is relatively easy enough, get a file that is generated by the OVSXmlSerializer
and it will de-parse it easily, assuming that you know the derived types.

## Attributes

Here are a few attributes that uses in its own `OVSXmlSerializer` namespace.
Note that `System.Xml.Serialization` will be converted automatically if needed.

1. `[XmlIgnore]` Ignores the field completely
2. `[XmlAttribute]` Adds *primitive value* as a single attribute to the class
    being serialized, can optionally add a name.
3. `[XmlNamedAs(string name)]` Changes the field name or object name to something 
   else on XML serialization.
4. `[XmlText]` Assuming that all other fields are attributes or ignored, this
   will write the primitive value  
5. `[XmlIgnoreConfigs]` Ignores all the customizable serializers when serializing
   the object or field. Most notably unsafe collections.

Arrays are automatically serialized as its own, and does follow the ignore configs
attribute.

## Custom Serializers

*introduced in 3.0.0*

While the serializable interface does work for basic situations, sometimes you
need a bit more control, or want to serialize something that is out of your reach
(i.e a dll file). One way is to add your own custom serializer that handles on
checking what conditions it follows. There is a few already added for `Datetime`
and `Timespan`. The default serializer list is as follows, and always goes latest
added first:

1. `ListInterfaceSerializer` Serializes the list with IList interface, same issue
   with dictionary serializer.
2. `ArraySerializer` Serializes the array as normal, knows what core element it is.
3. `DictionarySerializer` Serializes the dictionary using the IDictionary 
   interface, serializing the keys and values with types as the IDictionary doesn't
   provide generics.
4. `DatetimeSerializer` Serializes datetime as normal
5. `TimeSpanSerializer` First, and serializes timespan as normal

## OSDirectories

*introduced in 3.0.0*

Sub-branch of the current serializer, and included as an extra. Simply put, I
couldn't find a good library replacement for fileInfo since it doesn't perform 
well with Unix systems; So i took someone else's (cant remember who) and added
some additional functions. Have fun with that i suppose! Uses their own pre-processor
definition in case i manage to port it as a standalone library.
