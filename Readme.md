# Odd's Very Special Xml Serializer

..Or OVSXmlSerializer for short.



This is a specialized Xml Serializer that is mainly designed with use in B1NARY,
a visual novel about porn on the internet or whatever idfk not important. This
is used as a way to encapsulate and update the module over time when needed, 
typically as dll file or using the Nuget system.

The system itself works very similar to how the XML serializer works normally,
but is mean't to be worked with the `object` or more 'undefined' data that the 
ordinary XML serializer have difficulty handling. You can turn this off for more
traditional formatting with the config class, but it does reveal the issue once 
again.
