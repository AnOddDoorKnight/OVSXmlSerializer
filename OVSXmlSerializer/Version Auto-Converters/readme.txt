This portion here should simply be an additional interface that allows the end
user to update the older versions to the new version; hopefully recursively, in
order to create a smooth experience as much as possible without any workarounds.

We could tie this into the config, and change it's sensitivity, but Im not sure
how well this would function realistically. Sure, the .cs object may be changed itself,
but what about the fields below? how will that handle it? How will the user will 
write it specifically? will it be a series of steps? What about making sure the
configs stay consistent?

Alot of work will have to be done, but ill leave this here for now if anyone 
wants to challenge themselves and make sure to be as seamless as possible.

Good luck whoever wants to do this!
